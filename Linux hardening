In computing, hardening is usually the process of securing a system by reducing its surface of vulnerability, which is larger when a system performs more functions. In principle, a single-function system is more secure than a multipurpose one. The main goal of systems hardening is to reduce security risk by eliminating potential attack vectors and condensing the systemâ€™s attack surface.
